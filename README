This is a very basic 2D game engine I have created using C/C++, OpenGL and SDL2.
It has served mainly as a playground for me to explore engine development as I am fascinated with it!
It includes classes for:
  - Custom SDL Window creation (Window)
  - Loading png sprites and rendering them using vertex/fragment shaders (GLSLProgram)
  - Creating sprite batches for efficient sprite rendering (SpriteBatch)
  - Rendering fonts (SpriteFont)
  - Handling user input (InputManager)
  - Controlling the game world camera (Camera2D)
  - Calculating and limiting the fps (Timing)
  - Controlling the main game using a game interface (IMainGame, IGameScreen, ScreenList)
  - Simple debug rendering for outlining simple shapes (DebugRenderer)
  - Easy to set up and use User Interfaces using ImGui --> https://github.com/ocornut/imgui (GUI)
  - Basic Spritesheet handling, however it is really only useful for instances where the
    the spritesheet is completely uniform (SpriteSheet)
    
TODO: (functionality I plan on working on to further my knowledge of engine design)
  - Crossplatform development (this won't be a huge concern until I have adequetly learnt enough
    to begin developing an engine for release)
  - Upgrade window creation to account for all systems as well as resizing
  - Better spritesheet handling system to handle uneven spritesheets

A sample game (NinjaPlatformer) is provided which uses Mr.Engine to create a mini game and a level editor
  - Note: the level editor is unfinished, but has the ability to save a level and load it. 
  - todo: save and load game data using binary rather than text format. 

BUILDING (OSX only) :
  - Open MisterEngineLib.xcodeproj
  - Build this project in both Debug and Release mode
  - Test by running NinjaPlatformer.xcodeproj in release mode
